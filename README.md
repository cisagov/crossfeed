# Crossfeed

External monitoring for organization assets.

Crossfeed allows you to add a list of domains for each organization and periodically schedule passive or active scanning on them. Users of each organization can monitor their own assets through a self-service portal, and access to resources can be managed through RBAC.

Crossfeed is a collaboration between the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/) and the [Defense Digital Service](https://dds.mil/).
