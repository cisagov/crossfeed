# Federalist + U.S. Web Design System + Gatsby

This site is developed using the [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov) and is focused on providing developers a starter kit and reference implementation for Federalist websites.

This code uses the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) framework and built with Javascript and [React](https://reactjs.org/). If you prefer to use Ruby, check out [federalist-uswds-jekyll](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-jekyll), which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site engine.

This project assumes that you are comfortable editing source code. If you prefer to launch a website without editing any source code, checkout [uswds-jekyll](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll), which allows you to change the layout and content with configuration files.

This project strives to be compliant with requirements set by [21st Century IDEA Act](https://www.meritalk.com/articles/senate-passes-idea-act/). The standards require that a website or digital service:

- is accessible to individuals with disabilities;
- has a consistent appearance;
- does not duplicate any legacy websites (the legislation also requires agencies to ensure that legacy websites are regularly reviewed, removed, and consolidated);
- has a search function;
- uses an industry standard secure connection;
- ‚Äúis designed around user needs with data-driven analysis influencing management and development decisions, using qualitative and quantitative data to determine user goals, needs, and behaviors, and continually test the website, web-based form, web-based application, or digital service to ensure that user needs are addressed;‚Äù
- allows for user customization; and
- is mobile-friendly.

## üñêPrevious Versions üñê

If you're looking for the original starter that included a more integrated approach to using USWDS with React, it is still available [here](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby/tree/v1), but will not be maintained.

## Features

‚úÖ [USWDS v2](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov) javascript, styles, images, and fonts are included by default. Styles can be customized with either SASS or CSS in `src/styles/index.scss`.

‚úÖ Publish blog posts using Markdown. Any markdown files in the `src/blog-posts` directory will be turned into pages at `/blog/<path>` in the application using the `src/templates/blog-post.js` template, where `<path>` is specified in the frontmatter of the file. An index of all posts will be displayed at `/blog` using the `src/templates/blog.js` template.

‚úÖ Publish documentation pages using Markdown. Any markdown files in the `src/documentation-pages` directory will be turned into pages at `/<path>` in the application using the `src/templates/documentation-page.js` template, where `<path>` is specified in the frontmatter of the file. Side navigation for documentation pages can be controlled by setting `sidenav: true` or `sidenav: false` to your page front matter.

‚úÖ Publish custom pages using React. Any javascript files in the `src/pages` directory will be turned into pages at `/<filename>.html`, where `<filename>` is the actualy name of the file.

‚úÖ Customize SEO information for each page by adding the `src/components/seo.js` component to any page or template and providing the desired information. Ex. [Home page](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby/blob/main/src/pages/index.js#L11).

‚úÖ [Search.gov](https://search.gov) integration - Once you have registered and configured Search.gov for your site by following [these instructions](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/search/), add your "affiliate" and "access key" to `gatsby-config.js`. Ex.

```
searchgov: {

  // You should not change this.
  endpoint: 'https://search.usa.gov',

  // replace this with your search.gov account
  affiliate: 'federalist-uswds-example',

  // replace with your access key
  access_key: 'xX1gtb2RcnLbIYkHAcB6IaTRr4ZfN-p16ofcyUebeko=',

  // this renders the results within the page instead of sending to user to search.gov
  inline: true,
}
```

The logic for using Search.gov can be found in the `src/components/search-form.js` component and supports displaying the results inline or sending the user to Search.gov the view the results. This setting defaults to "inline" but can be changed by setting `searchgov: { inline: false }` in `gatsby-config.js`.

‚úÖ [Digital Analytics Program (DAP)](https://digital.gov/services/dap/) integration - Once you have registered your site with DAP add your "agency" and optionally, `subagency` to `gatsby-config.js` and uncomment the appropriate lines. Ex.

```
dap: {
    // agency: 'your-agency',

    // Optional
    // subagency: 'your-subagency',
},
```

‚úÖ [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) integration - If you have a Google Analytics account to use, add your "ua" to `gatsby-config.js` and uncomment the appropriate lines. Ex.

```
ga: {
    // ua: 'your-ua',
},
```

‚úÖ Out-of-the-box performant caching strategy following [Gatsby recommended practices](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/caching/) via `federalist.json`. See [Federalist Documentation](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/) for more information on `federalist.json`.

## Getting Started

- Return to [Federalist](https://federalistapp-staging.18f.gov/sites/new) and add the repository.

### Hard mode

#### With `npx` (requires node)
    $ npx degit https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby#main <destination-folder>
    $ cd <destination-folder>

#### Push to your Github repository
- [Create a new Github repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).
- Follow the instructions form Github or
```
    $ git init
    $ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main
    $ git add . && git commit -m 'Initial commit'
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-org>/<your-repo>.git
    (Make sure to replace `<your-org>` and `<your-repo>` above with the correct values)
    $ git push -u origin main
```

### Installation for development
    $ git clone https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby
    $ cd federalist-uswds-gatsby

### Running the application

#### With locally installed `node`
    $ npm install
    $ npm run develop

To build but not serve the site, run `npm run build`.

#### With Docker
    $ docker-compose run node npm install
    $ docker-compose up

To build but not serve the site, run:
```
docker-compose run node npm run build
```
.

Note that when built by Federalist, `npm run federalist` is used instead of
`npm run build`.

Open your web browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) to view your
site.

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

Note that when built by Federalist, `npm run federalist` is used instead of the
`build` script.

## Technologies you should be familiarize yourself with

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - The framework that does all the magic
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The view library
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - The data layer used by Gatsby
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Javascript runtime
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Javascript dependency manager
- [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov)

### üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## Things to Note

- The Federalist script runs the Gatsby build with the `--prefix-paths` flag. This is necessary to make sure all internal internal links point to the correct path for preview deployments.
- Always use the `Link` component provided by Gatsby for internal links, see previous note.
- Importing USWDS images can be done straight from their local location in `node_modules`. See [Banner.js](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby/blob/main/src/components/banner.js) for an example.
- This is built from the default [Gatsby default starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/), you can view the documentation there to see more of what is included.
