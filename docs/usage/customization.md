## Creating your own instance of Crossfeed

When you create your own instance of Crossfeed, you can customize many aspects of how it looks.

The `dev.env.example` file contains a full list of all customizable variables.

## User Agent and signing requests

Crossfeed's workers, when performing requets, can optionally send a User Agent identifying the requestor as Crossfeed
and a `Signature` header to verify that Crossfeed is performing the request.

To do this, you can set the `WORKER_USER_AGENT`, the `WORKER_SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY`, and the `WORKER_SIGNATURE_PRIVATE_KEY` parameters in your env file:

```
WORKER_USER_AGENT="Crossfeed (Test request from Crossfeed Staging Environment, for development use only. For more information, see https://github.com/cisagov/crossfeed)"
WORKER_SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY="public key, can have newlines"
WORKER_SIGNATURE_PRIVATE_KEY="private key, can have newlines"
```

### Generating RSA keys

The public and private key values can be generated by running:

```bash
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -f test_key
ssh-keygen -f test_key.pub -m 'PEM' -e > test_key.pem
```

The public key is the value of `test_key.pem` and the private key is the value of `test_key`.

### Verifying a request

One can then verify that requests are coming from Crossfeed by providing you with the following parts of the request:
- Value of the `Date` header
- Value of the `Signature` header
- Request method
- Request URL

You can call the `SignRequests.verify_signature` method (found in `backend/worker/mitmproxy_sign_requests.py`) to verify a signature with
the above four parts of a request. Crossfeed will later have an admin UI that allows admins to run this check directly from the web interface.

Note that when deploying Crossfeed to AWS, the worker signature public and private keys should also be set as SSM secrets (such as `/crossfeed/staging/WORKER_SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `/crossfeed/staging/WORKER_SIGNATURE_PRIVATE_KEY`).
