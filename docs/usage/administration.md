## Access control

Every user in Crossfeed has one of the following user types:

| User type    | Description                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Global Admin | Can invite any user, view or edit anything from all organizations                          |
| Global View  | Can view anything from all organizations                                                   |
| Standard     | Can only view / edit entities based on permissions delegated to them for each organization |

Standard users must be assigned a role for each organization that determines what permissions they have. These are the possible roles:

| User role | Description                                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin     | Can invite / remove users, edit domains, schedule scans for their own organization |
| User      | Can only view information for their own organization                               |
