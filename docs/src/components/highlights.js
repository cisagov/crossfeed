              Graphic headings can be used a few different ways, depending on
              what your landing page is for. Highlight your values, specific
              program areas, or results.

            <p>
              Keep body text to about 30 words. They can be shorter, but try to
              be somewhat balanced across all four. It creates a clean
              appearance with good spacing.

              In addition to your goal, find out your usersâ€™ goals. What do they
              want to know or do that supports your mission? Use these headings
              to show those.
