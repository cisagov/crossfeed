## Creating your own instance of Crossfeed

When you create your own instance of Crossfeed, you can customize many aspects of how it looks. The `dev.env.example` file contains a full list of all customizable variables.

To deploy Crossfeed for the first time in a fresh AWS environment, you need to do a couple of things:

- Set up a custom domain for the frontend and create an ACM certificate for it
- Set up authentication mechanism (Cognito or login.gov) Generate a login.gov RSA key
- Set initial SSM variables
- Configure User Agent and request signing
- Configure other environment variables

### Set up a custom domain for the frontend

Pick a custom domain for your frontend and create an [ACM certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) for your domain. Then, set the `frontend_domain` and `frontend_cert_arn` variables in `infrastructure/stage.tfvars` and `infrastructure/prod.tfvars` accordingly.

### Set up authentication mechanism (Cognito or login.gov)

Choose between using Cognito or login.gov. login.gov can only be used if you are
a government agency, so you'll most likely just want to use Cognito.

#### Cognito setup

You can perform these Cognito setup steps after the user pools have been created after you first run Terraform ([mentioned below](#use-terraform)).

In `backend/env.yml`, set the following variables:

```
USE_COGNITO: 1
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID: us-east-1_uxiY8DOum
```

In `frontend/stage.env` / `frontend/prod.env`, make sure the following environment variables are set:

```
REACT_APP_USE_COGNITO=1
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_uxiY8DOum
REACT_APP_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=1qf4cii9v0t9hn1hnr54f2ao0j
```

#### login.gov setup

In `backend/env.yml`, `frontend/stage.env`, and `frontend/prod.env`, remove the lines that set the `USE_COGNITO` or `REACT_APP_USE_COGNITO` environment variables. Both variables must be unset for login.gov authentication to be used!

Run the following to generate a login.gov RSA key (preferably in a non-git directory outside of crossfeed!):

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 3650 -out csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -out cert.pem -signkey private.pem
npm install -g pem-jwk
pem-jwk private.pem > private.jwk
```

Visit [the Login.gov sandbox dashboard](https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov/) to create a login.gov application, providing `cert.pem` as the public certificate. Copy the contents of `private.jwk` to use as your `LOGIN_GOV_JWT_KEY`, which is stored in SSM in the next step.

### Set initial SSM variables

First, make sure you set the following SSM variables manually through the AWS Console (replace `staging` with `prod` as needed). Make sure these variables are set as "SecureString":

- `/crossfeed/staging/DATABASE_USER`
- `/crossfeed/staging/DATABASE_PASSWORD`
- `/crossfeed/staging/APP_JWT_SECRET`
- `/crossfeed/staging/CENSYS_API_ID`
- `/crossfeed/staging/CENSYS_API_SECRET`
- `/crossfeed/staging/SHODAN_API_KEY`
- `/crossfeed/staging/LOGIN_GOV_REDIRECT_URI`
- `/crossfeed/staging/LOGIN_GOV_BASE_URL`
- `/crossfeed/staging/LOGIN_GOV_JWT_KEY`
- `/crossfeed/staging/LOGIN_GOV_ISSUER`
- `/crossfeed/staging/WORKER_USER_AGENT`
- `/crossfeed/staging/WORKER_SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `/crossfeed/staging/WORKER_SIGNATURE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `/crossfeed/staging/REACT_APP_TERMS_VERSION`

### Use Terraform

Run `cd infrastructure`. Then, run `cp stage.config .env` and change the variables in `.env` to use a bucket you have access to to store state.

Make sure you configure the default AWS profile using `aws configure` , or set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable in `.env`.

You must also [create a service-linked role for Amazon ES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/slr-es.html#create-slr) (this only needs to be created once per AWS account):

```bash
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name es.amazonaws.com
```

Then run:

```bash
npm i -g dotenv-cli
make init
make plan
make apply
```

### Configure User Agent and request signing

Crossfeed's workers, when performing requets, can optionally send a User Agent identifying the requestor as Crossfeed
and a `Signature` header to verify that Crossfeed is performing the request.

To do this, you can set the `WORKER_USER_AGENT`, the `WORKER_SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY`, and the `WORKER_SIGNATURE_PRIVATE_KEY` parameters in your env file:

```
WORKER_USER_AGENT="Crossfeed (Test request from Crossfeed Staging Environment, for development use only. For more information, see https://github.com/cisagov/crossfeed)"
WORKER_SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY="public key, can have newlines"
WORKER_SIGNATURE_PRIVATE_KEY="private key, can have newlines"
```

#### Generating RSA keys

The public and private key values can be generated by running:

```bash
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -f test_key
ssh-keygen -f test_key.pub -m 'PEM' -e > test_key.pem
```

The public key is the value of `test_key.pem` and the private key is the value of `test_key`.

#### Verifying a request

One can then verify that requests are coming from Crossfeed by providing you with the following parts of the request:

- Value of the `Date` header
- Value of the `Signature` header
- Request method
- Request URL

You can call the `SignRequests.verify_signature` method (found in `backend/worker/mitmproxy_sign_requests.py`) to verify a signature with
the above four parts of a request. Crossfeed will later have an admin UI that allows admins to run this check directly from the web interface.

Note that when deploying Crossfeed to AWS, the worker signature public and private keys should also be set as SSM secrets (such as `/crossfeed/staging/WORKER_SIGNATURE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `/crossfeed/staging/WORKER_SIGNATURE_PRIVATE_KEY`).

### Configure other environment variables

The full list of configurable environment variables are provided in `.env` (used in local development), `frontend/stage.env`, `frontend/prod.env`, and `backend/env.yml`. Additionally, more settings from the Terraform end are stored in `infrastructure/stage.tfvars` and `infrastructure/prod.tfvars`.
