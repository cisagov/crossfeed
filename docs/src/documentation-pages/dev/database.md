Crossfeed uses a relational database that uses Postgres. When running Crossfeed locally, the database is served from the container `crossfeed_db_1`. We rarely issue direct SQL queries to the database, but instead
use [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) to communicate with it.

### Directory structure

The `backend/src/models` folder contains all the TypeORM models.

The database is deployed onto AWS RDS. Configuration for this deployment is located in `infrastructure/database.tf`.

### Models

Here is a list of database models used by Crossfeed:

| Model Name      | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain          | A Domain stores a record for each domain / subdomain found by Crossfeed.                     |
| Service         | A Service runs on a given port on a domain, for example, "http" or "ftp".                    |
| Vulnerability   | A Vulnerability is an indicator of a vulnerability, unique to a domain, such as a CVE.       |
| Webpage         | A Webpage is a web path that has been scraped on a Domain.                                   |
| ApiKey          | An ApiKey can be generated by users to programmatically access the Crossfeed API.            |
| Organization    | An Organization represents an entity to be scanned that has a defined scope of root domains. |
| OrganizationTag | An OrganizationTag can be used to group multiple organizations.                              |
| Role            | A Role represents a User's access level to an Organization.                                  |
| User            | A User is an account that can access Crossfeed.                                              |
| SavedSearch     | A SavedSearch is a search that a User has saved.                                             |
| Scan            | A Scan is a scheduled data collection job.                                                   |
| ScanTask        | A ScanTask represents a specific run, at a certain time and date, of a Scan.                 |

### Syncing the database

You should sync the database using the `syncdb` command whenever models change and
you want to update the database schemas.

```bash
cd backend
# Generate schema
npm run syncdb
# Populate sample data
npm run syncdb -- -d populate
```

### Manual access

To manually access the database, we use AWS Session Manager. This way, we don't need to run an EC2 bastion instance that's exposed to the public Internet.

- Install the [Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) to the AWS CLI on your development machine.
- Set up a Session Manager port forwarding session to allow SSH access to the instance.

  ```bash
  # Set this environment variable to the ID of the EC2 bastion instance (which should be in a private subnet, but able to connect to the RDS instance).
  export INSTANCE_ID=
  # Generate an SSH key and send it to the EC2 instance
  # (this only needs to be done once).
  ssh-keygen -f cisa_bastion_rsa
  aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key \
      --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID \
      --availability-zone us-east-1b \
      --instance-os-user ec2-user \
      --ssh-public-key file://cisa_bastion_rsa.pub

  # Start port forwarding.
  aws ssm start-session \
      --target $INSTANCE_ID \
      --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \
      --parameters '{"portNumber":["22"], "localPortNumber":["9999"]}'
  ```

- In another terminal, forward the RDS connection to your local computer using the SSH connection from earlier:

  ```bash
  # Set this environment variable to the URL of the RDS instance (XXX.rds.amazonaws.com)
  export RDS_URL=

  # Forward RDS instance to localhost:5432
  ssh ec2-user@localhost \
      -p 9999 \
      -N \
      -i cisa_bastion_rsa \
      -L 5432:$RDS_URL:5432
  ```

- You should now be able to connect to the database directly from your local computer (with the actual RDS database credentials), at the URL `localhost:5432`. You can use a tool such as [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) to more easily handle / manage connections.

These steps for manual access are based on [Connect to a private RDS instance using SSH & AWS SSM (Systems Manager)](https://checkmysite.io/blog/using-aws-systems-manager-and-ssh-to-access-an-rds-instance).
