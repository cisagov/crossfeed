sidenav: dev

This quickstart describes the initial setup required to run an instance of Crossfeed on your local computer.

### Initial Setup

1. Mac Users - before starting the initial setup, ensure you have already completed the following: [development environment for mac-based computers](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/blob/develop/dev_envs/mac-env-setup.md).

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 18 and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

3. Copy root `dev.env.example` file to a `.env` file.

   ```bash
   cp dev.env.example .env
   ```

4. Build the crossfeed-worker Docker image:

   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run build-worker
   ```

5. Start the entire environment from the root directory:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Generate the initial DB schema and populate it with sample data:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Generate schema
   npm run syncdb
   # Populate sample data
   npm run syncdb -- -d populate
   ```

   If you ever need to drop and recreate the database, you can run `npm run syncdb -- -d dangerouslyforce`.

7. Navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost) in a browser.  The first time please navigate to [http://localhost/signup](http://localhost/signup) to create account. Local accounts can be set to Global Admin to aide in development.

8. Hot reloading for source files is enabled, but after changes to non-source code files stopping and starting Docker Compose is required. The following are examples of changes that will require restarting the environment:

   - Frontend or backend dependency changes
   - Backend changes to `serverless.yml` or `env.yml`
   - Environment variables in root `.env`

9. Install [Prettier](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode) in your dev environment to format code on save.

### Running tests

To run tests, first make sure you have already started Crossfeed with `npm start` (or, at bare minimum, that the database container is running). Then run:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

If snapshot tests fail, update snapshots by running `npm test -- -u`.

To run tests for the subset of worker code that is written in Python, you need to run:

```bash
pip install -r worker/requirements.txt
pytest
```

To view a code coverage report (a minimum code coverage threshold is checked in CI), run `npm test -- --collectCoverage`. You can then view a HTML coverage report in the `coverage/lcov-report` directory.

### Monitoring Docker containers

To see which Docker containers are running, you can run:

```bash{outputLines: 2-10}
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES

```

You can then check the logs of a particular container by specifying a container's name with the `docker logs` command. For example:

```bash
docker logs crossfeed_backend_1 --follow
```

### Further information

To see more information about the design and development of each component of Crossfeed,
see the following links:

- [Frontend](frontend.md) for the React frontend.
- [REST API](rest-api.md) for the REST API.
- [Database](database.md) for the database models stored in Postgres.
- [Worker](worker.md) for the worker system and adding new scans and data sources.
- [Search](search.md) for the search infrastructure and setup with Elasticsearch.
- [Analytics](analytics.md) for the analytics setup with Matomo.

### Documentation

The documentation files are stored in the `docs` directory and served from a Gatsby site. To work on this, you should run `npm start` from before. You can then open up [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to view the docs.

The docs are based on the [federalist-uswds-gatsby](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby) theme. See that repository for more information on additional theme customizations that can be done.

### Common Issues

- Node Error issue occurs due to "npm install"

```bash
    npm ERR! code EBADENGINE
	npm ERR! engine Unsupported engine
	npm ERR! engine Not compatible with your version of node/npm: crossfeed-backend@1.0.0
	npm ERR! notsup Not compatible with your version of node/npm: crossfeed-backend@1.0.0
	npm ERR! notsup Required: {"node":">=16.0.0 <17.0.0"}
	npm ERR! notsup Actual:   {"npm":"9.5.0","node":"v18.14.2"}

	npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
    npm ERR!     /Users/combsc/.npm/_logs/2023-03-10T20_01_15_851Z-debug-0.log
```

In this case install nvm for nodes 16.0.0 to 17.0.0.
for example `nvm install 16.19.0` then check it by `node -- version` and `npm -- version`

- Sometimes you may get an error in package-lock.json. This error is due to the package downloading the docker build. Remove the package-lock.json file and reinstall it using `npm install`.

```bash
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
```

If successful then continue to step 3.

- Permission Issue / Permissions not permitted / Operation not permitted / Module build Failed

```bash
   Failed to compile.
	crossfeed-frontend-1  |
	crossfeed-frontend-1  | Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open '/app/src/index.tsx'
	crossfeed-frontend-1  | ERROR in ./src/index.tsx
	crossfeed-frontend-1  | Module build failed (from ./node_modules/source-map-loader/dist/cjs.js):
	crossfeed-frontend-1  | Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open '/app/src/index.tsx'
	crossfeed-frontend-1  |
	crossfeed-frontend-1  | ERROR in [eslint] EPERM: operation not permitted, open '/app/src/index.tsx'
	crossfeed-frontend-1  |
	crossfeed-frontend-1  | webpack compiled with 2 errors
    crossfeed-frontend-1  | No issues found.
```

If you receive the above error check the following:

```bash
   system settings > Privacy & Security > Files and Folder > "Find Docker" > click on Docker > Under Documents Folder ensure its on by swipping right and showing blue icon.
```

If the above is correct try looking into the [development environment for mac-based computers](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/blob/develop/dev_envs/mac-env-setup.md). Then Review the **account permissions** as necessary.
