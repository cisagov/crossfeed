This quickstart describes the initial setup required to run an instance of Crossfeed on your local computer.

### Initial Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 14 and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Make sure the Docker daemon is running.

2. Copy root `dev.env.example` file to a `.env` file.

   ```bash
   cp dev.env.example .env
   ```

3. Build the crossfeed-worker Docker image:

   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run build-worker
   ```

4. Start the entire environment from the root directory:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Generate the initial DB schema and populate it with sample data:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Generate schema
   docker-compose exec backend npx sls invoke local -f syncdb
   # Populate sample data
   docker-compose exec backend npx sls invoke local -f syncdb -d populate
   ```

   If you ever need to drop and recreate the database, you can run `npm run syncdb -- -d dangerouslyforce`.

6. Navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost) in a browser.

7. Hot reloading for source files is enabled, but after changes to non-source code files stopping and starting Docker Compose is required. The following are examples of changes that will require restarting the environment:

   - Frontend or backend dependency changes
   - Backend changes to `serverless.yml` or `env.yml`
   - Environment variables in root `.env`

8. Install [Prettier](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode) in your dev environment to format code on save.

### Running tests

To run tests, first make sure you have already started Crossfeed with `npm start` (or, at bare minimum, that the database container is running). Then run:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

If snapshot tests fail, update snapshots by running `npm test -- -u`.

To run tests for the subset of worker code that is written in Python, you need to run:

```bash
pip install -r worker/requirements.txt
pytest
```

To view a code coverage report (a minimum code coverage threshold is checked in CI), run `npm test -- --collectCoverage`. You can then view a HTML coverage report in the `coverage/lcov-report` directory.

### Monitoring Docker containers

To see which Docker containers are running, you can run:

```bash{outputLines: 2-10}
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES

```

You can then check the logs of a particular container by specifying a container's name with the `docker logs` command. For example:

```bash
docker logs crossfeed_backend_1 --follow
```

### Documentation

The documentation files are stored in the `docs` directory and served from a Gatsby site. To work on this, you should run `npm start` from before. You can then open up [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to view the docs.

The docs are based on the [federalist-uswds-gatsby](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby) theme. See that repository for more information on additional theme customizations that can be done.
