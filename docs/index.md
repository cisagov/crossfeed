# Crossfeed Documentation

Crossfeed is a tool that continuously enumerates and monitors an organization's public-facing attack surface in order to discover assets and flag potential security flaws. By operating in either passive or active scanning modes, Crossfeed collects data from a variety of open source tools and data feeds to provide actionable information about organization assets. Crossfeed is offered as a self-service portal and allows customers to view reports and customize scans performed.

Crossfeed is a collaboration between the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/) and the [Defense Digital Service](https://dds.mil/).
